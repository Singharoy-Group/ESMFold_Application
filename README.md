# ESMFold_Application

1. To create initial sequences, use create_library_v2.py. Save the generated list of squences to a txt file like 'list1.txt'
2. To generate the sequences use folding.sh. Make sure to change the submission script according to your machine specs and the input txt file with the generated sequences.
3. Before running ESMFold, make sure you have both the (a) tokenizer and (b) model from  https://huggingface.co/facebook/esmfold_v1 as referenced https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/protein_folding.ipynbby jupyter notebook
